Diagnosis for the prediction of knee osteoporosis using deep learning techniques.

The dataset consists of 1650 digital X-ray images of knee joint which are collected from well reputed hospitals and diagnostic centres. The X-ray images are acquired using PROTEC PRS 500E X-ray machine. Original images are 8-bit grayscale image. Each radiographic knee X-ray image is manually annotated /labelled as per Kellgren and Lawrence grades by 2 medical experts. A novel approach has been developed to automatically extract the Cartilage region (region of interest) based on density of pixels. The target is to evaluate the performance of the deep learning algorithm to predict per Kellgren and Lawrence grades.

the Kellgren and Lawrence classification system: grade 0 (normal): definite absence of x-ray changes of osteoarthritis grade 1 (doubtful): doubtful joint space narrowing and possible osteophytic lipping grade 2 (mid): definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing grade 3 (moderate): moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space and some sclerosis and possible deformity of bone ends grade 4 (severe): large osteophytes, marked narrowing of joint space, severe sclerosis and definite deformity of bone ends. he target is to evaluate the performance of the deep learning algorithm to predict per Kellgren and Lawrence grades.
